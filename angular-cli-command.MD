The Angular CLI makes it easy to start small and gradually add dependencies as needed.

Step 1

ng new simple-app --minimal --skip-tests --skip-install --dry-run

Step 2

ng new simple-app --minimal --skip-tests --skip-install

Now, rerun the command without the --dry-run option, and you'll have a very minimal Angular app to work with. No tests, and very few dependencies.

Step 3

npm install
After you've had time to examine the files that were created, you'll need to run npm install from within your project directory to install the required dependencies.

Step 4

ng build
At this point, you'll have a ready-to-run app with a fairly minimal set of dependencies.
